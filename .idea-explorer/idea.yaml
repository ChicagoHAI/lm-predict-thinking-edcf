  title: Can LMs predict their own thinking tokens?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Language models can predict the number of tokens they will generate
    (i.e., their own "thinking time") before producing a response.

    '
  background:
    description: Can language models predict how long they will think? When I use
      ChatGPT, it's really annoying when it thinks and I don't know how long it will
      take to respond.
